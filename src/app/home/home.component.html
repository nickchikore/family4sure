    'Evidently COVID-19 has left people at more risks of isolation, increased anxiety, depression and loneliness (UCL, 2020). Main risk factors being people with lower income, and from BAME background (UCL, 2020). Therefore our bespoke volunteer led befriending service will take time to help these people reach their potential through talking therapy and group therapy sessions. Intervening early to tackle loneliness and social isolation during the COVID-19 will help to prevent more health and care needs from developing, as well as aiding community resilience and recovery (Local Government association, 2021).'
